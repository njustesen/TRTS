# Turn-based Real-time Strategy Game

This is the repository for the Tapletop Real-time Strategy (TRTS) project which aims to build a core ruleset for playing Real-time Strategy (RTS) game-like board games, supporting several key features from the video game genre, such as: 

- Fog-of-war
- Information gathering (scouting)
- Build-order planning
- Area control
- Worker harassment
- Economy building
- Strategic army composition
- Tactical army movement

The core ruleset can be extended with **game add-ons** that are used to simulate a specific RTS video game. Our main focus is on the StarCraft series.
