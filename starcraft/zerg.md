# Zerg

## Special Rules

- _Creep_: Any area with a finished Hatchary on it also has creep on it. Creep allows other Zerg strucutures than the Hatchery to be morphed in this area. Additionally, no other stuctures than Zerg's can be constructed in this area.
- _Regeneration_: All Zerg units and structures heal 1 lost HP in the Income Phase.

- (x2): These units are morphed in pairs at the total cost shown in the table.
- x: Eggs cost supply equivalent of what's in them. 
- a: Acid Spores: Read rules under Devourer.
- e: Explosive Attack, c: Concussive Attack, s: Splash Damage.

### Drone

**Abilities**:
- _Hovering_
- _Resource Gathering_: Drones can collect 1 mineral (max. one per mineral field) or 1 gas (requires an Extractor) in the income phase.

**Morphs Into**
- _Any Zerg Structure_: Drones can morph into any Zerg structure by paying its cost, if the requirements are met. Replace the Drone with the structure which cannot be used before the Deployment phase and it will have half HP (rounded down) until it's done. Drones can cancel the morphing process before the Deployment Phase. To do so, replace the structure with the Drone and retake the resources spent.
