- _Regeneration_: All Zerg units and structures heal 1 lost HP in the Income Phase.

- _Burrow_: Zerg ground units that has the _burrow_ ability can at any time _burrow_ or _unborrow_ during the _Macromanagement phase_ and can _burrow_ at the beginning of every combat as well. _Burrowed_ units are _cloaked_ and cannot do anything other than _unborrowing_, unless the have special rules allowing them.
