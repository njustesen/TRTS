### Drone

**Abilities**:
- _Hovering_
- _Resource Gathering_: Drones can collect 1 mineral (max. one per mineral field) or 1 gas (requires an Extractor) in the income phase.

**Morphes Into**
- _Any Zerg Structure_: Drones can morph into any Zerg structure by paying its cost, if the requirements are met. Replace the Drone with the structure which cannot be used before the Deployment phase and it will have half HP (rounded down) until it's done. Drones can cancel the morphing process before the Deployment Phase. To do so, replace the structure with the Drone and retake the resources spent.
