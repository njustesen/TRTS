# Zerg

## Starts With
- 1 Hatchery
- 2 Drones
- 1 Overlord

## Special Rules

- _Creep_: Any area with a finished Hatchary on it also has creep on it. Creep allows other Zerg strucutures than the Hatchery to be morphed in this area. Additionally, no other stuctures than Zerg's can be constructed in this area.
- _Regeneration_: All Zerg units and structures heal 1 lost HP in the Income Phase.
- _Morphing_: Zerg units and structures can _morph_ into other units and structures in the _Production Phase_.
- _Burrow_: Zerg ground units that has the _burrow_ ability can at any time _burrow_ or _unborrow_ during the _Macromanagement phase_ and can _burrow_ at the beginning of every combat as well. _Burrowed_ units are _cloaked_ and cannot do anything other than _unborrowing_, unless the have special rules allowing them.

- _Resource Gathering_: Drones can collect 1 mineral (max. one per mineral field) or 1 gas (requires an Extractor) in the income phase.

**Morphs Into**
- _Any Zerg Structure_: Drones can morph into any Zerg structure by paying its cost, if the requirements are met. Replace the Drone with the structure which cannot be used before the Deployment phase and it will have half HP (rounded down) until it's done. Drones can cancel the morphing process before the Deployment Phase. To do so, replace the structure with the Drone and retake the resources spent.

### Overlord

Gives +2 Supply.

**Abilities**:
- _Flying_
- _Detector_

### Zergling

Two Zerglings comes out of one Egg for the cost of [1 min, 1 sup].

### Defiler

Defilers start with 1/4 energy.

- _Consume_: Allows the Defiler to eat a friendly Zerg unit, taking its life and giving the Defiler 1 more energy up to it's maximum energy level.
- _Dark Swarm_ [2 energy]: Allows the Defiler to cast a dark swarm in an area. No ground units take direct damage from ranged attacks in this area this round, except fo splash damage.
- _Plague_ [3 energy]: Allows the Defiler to cast Plague on up to 4 small, 3 medium, 2 large units of the same type, or 1 structure. Plagued units and buildings lose 1 HP now (ignoring armor). Plague can never kill or destroy a building and thus cannot reduce HP lower than 1 HP. Plagued units with 1 HP left after this initial reduction cannot use their armor this turn. Plagued targets are dealt 6 additional damage at the end of this turn, and again not to a lower value than 1 HP, wherefter targets are no longer plagued.

### Queen

Queens start with 1/4 energy.

**Abilities**:
- _Infest Command Center_: Infests heavily damaged (< 50% HP) Terran Command Center to make an Infested Command Center under control.

- _Ensnare_ [3 Energy]: Targets 4 small, 3 medium or 2 large unborrowed units that will get their attack and speed cut in half for the rest of the round, both the speed stat and any remaining movement points. Cloaked units hit by Ensnare also become visible, and yes, they can be targeted.
- _Spawn Broodling_ [1 Energy]: A Queen with this ability can instantaneously destroy any non-robotic ground unit in the game as the Broodling larvae she plants rapidly mature and, feeding on the victim from the inside, destroy their host. Remove the target and add to Broodlings in the area that becomes under control. At the end of the next round, the spawned Broodlings will run out of energy and die. Archons and Dark Archons cannot be targeted by this ability.

### Devourer

### Hatchery

Required in an area to collect resources.

### Lair
Same rules as the Hatchery, with these additions:

**Upgrades**:
* _Ventral Sacs_ [3 min, 3 gas]: Gives Overlords the ability to transport up to 8 units, where medium units counts as 2, and large units counts as 4.
* _Antennae_ [3 min, 3 gas]: Increases the Overlord's vision radius by 2 (from 9 to 11).
* _Pneumatized Caraspace_ [3 min, 3 gas]: +1 Overload speed.

### Hive
Same rules as the Lair.

### Nydus Canal

The Nydus Canal allows the Zerg player to instantly transport ground units between the two linked Nydus Canals without spending movement ppints. When the Nydus Canal is deployed, a second Nydus Canal (called a Nydus Canal Exit) can then be produced on Creep in any Area under control for free. The original Nydus Canal and its complementary Canal Exit are then linked, allowing Zerg units to enter either Canal, immediately exiting out through its counterpart Canal.
