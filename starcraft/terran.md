# Terran

## Special Rules

- _Burning Buildings_: Terran buildings with 1 HP left by the end of the turn will be destroyed.
- _Add-ons_: Add-ons are small buildings that can be added onto another building. Add-ons can be constructed without an SCV while the main building cannot be used for anything else until the add-on is deployed. Buildings can at most have one add-on and only those listed in their rules.
- _Lift Off_: Terran buildings with the _Lift Off_ ability can become flying with speed 1. This ability can only be used in the Movement phase and the building cannot move after _lifting off_. When _lifted_, the building can land during the movement phase. Any add-ons on the lifted building remain on the ground and cannot be used but can be attached to any landing building that fits with the add-on.
