### Probe

_Resource gathering_: Probes can collect 1 mineral (max. one per mineral field) or 1 gas (requires an assimilaor) in the income phase.
_Warping_: Probes can warp in a building by paying its cost. Warped-in buildings cannot be used before the Deployment phase. 
Buildings with the _powered_ ability requires a Pylon under control to be present in the area. 

### High Templar

High Templars are spell casters and can cast one of the following spells per turn:

_Psionic Storm_: During combat, target up to four small, three medium, or two large units of the same type. Target units are dealt 2 damage (ignoring armor) for units with speed 0-2 and 1 damage (ignoring armor) to units with speed 3+. Psionic Storm is not stackable so casting more than one on the same target in the same combat does not cause more damage. Psionic Storm does not damage units under a Stasis Field.
