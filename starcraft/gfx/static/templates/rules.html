                                Starting with units with the highest Range, also considering spells, perform a Combat Step wherein these units can attack or cast spells.
                                In a Combat Step, first, the attacking player assigns targets and declares spells being casted, followed by the defending players in the current turn order.

                                All damage and spells of a Combat Step take effect simultaneously before moving on the the next Combat Step.
                                Remove any units that are killed and use tokens to show lost health and shield points.
                                Units can decide not to attack, or can attack in a later combat step.

                                    When assigning targets, split the units that will attack in this Combat Step into groups by which unit type they will target.
                                    Spell casters can declare which spells they are casting and their targets.

                                    Air units can freely select their targets while ground units can only select targets that have the same or lower Range value.
                                    If there are no units with the same or lower Range, ground units have to select targets in ascending order of Range.
                                    Units or structures without a Range value are always targeted last unless they have used a spell in this Combat in which their Range value is equal to the lowest range of the spells.

                                    To determine the amount of damage a unit will deal to the enemy, calculate their modified attack value (MAV).
                                    The attacker can allocate the damage as they wish among the target of the same type.

                                    MAV can never be lower than 1, except for workers which always have MAV = ½. Workers thus need to attack in pairs to deal any damage.
