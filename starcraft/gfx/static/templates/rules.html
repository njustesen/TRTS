                                    If there are no enemy units with the same or lower Range, ground units have to select targets in ascending order of Range.
                                    Spell-casters and non-defensive structures are always targeted last by ground units unless they have used spells in this Combat in which their Range value is equal to the lowest range of those spells.
                                    Workers in combat can be targeted normally while other workers are targeted last together with spell-casters.
