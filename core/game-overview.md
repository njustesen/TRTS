# Game Rules

## Overview
A TRTS game is played over a series of rounds and ends in one of the following ways:

- The final round has ended and several players are still in the game, in which case the player with the most **areas** under control wins*.
- A player is eliminated. The victory conditions in this case differs from the match type:
  - In a **2-player** match, the eliminated player lose the game, and the remaining player wins.
  - In a **team** match, the team of the elimnated player lose the game, and the other team wins.
  - In a **free-for-all** match, the player with the most **areas** under controls win*.
  - In a **last-man-standing** match, the game continues if there are more than two player remaining, otherwise the remaining player claims the victory.

*In case of a tie, it is the player with the most units (counted by supply) that wins.

## Setup

Place the **Game Board** somewhere on the table so it can be reached by all players.

Randomly determine the **Starting Location** on the map of each player and sit somewhere near your starting area.

Each player places a **Player Board** in front of them and collects all the **Unit Models**, **Building Tokens** and **Upgrade Tokens**, as well as a set of **Resource Counters** (25 mineral and gas tokens) and place all of it right in front of the **Player Board**.

It is important that no player can see what is behind the other players' **Player Boards**.

Before the game starts, each players' **Starting Player Tokens** are shuffled and a random order is determined. 

Place the** Starting Player Tokens** next to the **Turn Sequence Board**, and move the first **Starting Player Token** to the **Income** phase on the **Turn Sequence Board**.

Place the **Turn Marker** on the square marked with the number **1** on the **Turn Sequence Board**.

## Turn Sequence 

Each round has a number of phases that is managed by the starting player. The **Starting Player Token** on the **Turn Sequence Board** is used to indicate the current phase of the turn.

When the first round is over, the **Starting Player Token** is moved to the end of the line of **Starting Player Tokens** and the **Turn Marker** is moved one square forward. 
Then, the next **Starting Player Token** is used moved to the **Income** phase to initiate a new round.

### Income

### Deployment

### Production

### Engagement
In the current player turn order, perform one or more _engangements_ with one group of units, until all players have passed.
An engaging group of units does not have to start in the same **area** but they have to initiate the engagement into same **area** that is either contested or controlled by other players.

To make an _engagement_, move a group of units from to an **area** that's not under your control. 

Here, there are 3 possible scenarios:

1. If the **Area** is _neutral_, place one of your **Control Markers** on the engaged **Area**. You now control the engaged **Area**. 

2. If the **Area** is under control of other players, place one of your **Control Marker** on the **Game Board Area** to indicate the engagement. 
The player controlling the **Area** has to say whether or not there are any units or buildings.

* If there are no units/buildings in the engaged **Area**, keep your **Control Marker** on the **Game Baord Area** and remove any **Control Markers** of other players. 
You now control the engaged **Area**.

* If there are units/buildings, immediately move all units into the **Area** onto the **Game Board** **Area** so they become visible to anyone, including the engaging units.
Then, carry out a _combat_ round, described in the next section.

3. If the **Area** is contested and you have a **Control Marker** on the **Area**, move the units directly to the new **Game Board Area** and perform a round of combat.

If some of the engaging units have movement points left after making an _engagement_, they can immediately perform another _engagement_ or move to adjacent **Area** under control. When the _engagement_ is over, the units can no longer move or retreat in this turn.

### Combat
A _combat round_ is performed in several _combat steps_ where units with the long range attack first. In each _combat step_, units and buildings that share the _range_ value of the current _combat step_ can _attack_ and _cast spells_. A _combat round_ thus starts with the highest range of any unit in the **Area**, then the next highest, the third, and so on until all units have had a change to act. 

During a combat step, the following happens:

1. All units with a greater _sight_ value than the _range_ value of the current _combat step_ can retreat to any adjacent **Area** under control or contested by the units' owner, given they have enough movement points left.

2. Units that match the _range_ value of the current _combat step_ can attack or cast a spell. This is done in the **player turn order** but the damage are allocated simulatenously. The amount of damage each unit deals is described in the next section. Remove any units that died and place damage tokens to reflect any damage to surviving units/buildings.

3. In the **player turn order** units that match the _range_ value of the current _combat step_ can retreat to any adjacent **Area** under control or contested by the units' owner, if they have enough movement points left. 

Retreating units can use all their movement points to move severeal **Areas** away from the engaged **Area**. 

Units can only retreat through contested **Areas** if an owned **Control Marker** is on the contested **Area** and the retreating units will not be pinned. Pinning rules are describe in the Movement section.

Retreating units cannot move anymore this turn. 

Units and buildings can only attack one time in a turn even if they take part of multiple combat rounds.
