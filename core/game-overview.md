# Game Overview

A TRTS game is played over a series of rounds and ends in one of the following ways:

- The final round has ended and several players are still in the game, in which case the player with the most areas under control wins*.
- A player is eliminated. The victory conditions in this case differs from the match type:
  - In a **2-player** match, the eliminated player lose the game, and the remaining player wins.
  - In a **team** match, the team of the elimnated player lose the game, and the other team wins.
  - In a **free-for-all** match, the player with the most areas under controls win*.
  - In a **last-man-standing** match, the game continues if there are more than two player remaining, otherwise the remaining player claims the victory.

*In case of a tie, it is the player with the most units (counted by supply) that wins.

# Setup

Place the **Game Board** somewhere on the table so it can be reached by all players.

Randomly determine the **Starting Location** on the map of each player and sit somewhere near your starting area.

Each player places a **Player Board** in front of them and collects all the **Unit Models**, **Building Tokens** and **Upgrade Tokens**, as well as a set of **Resource Counters** (25 mineral and gas tokens) and place all of it right in front of the **Player Board**.

It is important that no player can see what is behind the other players' **Player Boards**.

Before the game starts, each players' **Starting Player Tokens** are shuffled and a random order is determined. 

Place the** Starting Player Tokens** next to the **Turn Sequence Board**, and move the first **Starting Player Token** to the **Income** phase on the **Turn Sequence Board**.

Place the **Turn Marker** on the square marked with the number **1** on the **Turn Sequence Board**.

# Turn Sequence 

Each round has a number of phases that is managed by the starting player. The **Starting Player Token** on the **Turn Sequence Board** is used to indicate the current phase of the turn.

When the first round is over, the **Starting Player Token** is moved to the end of the line of **Starting Player Tokens** and the **Turn Marker** is moved one square forward. 
Then, the next **Starting Player Token** is used moved to the **Income** phase to initiate a new round.

## Engagement
In the current player turn order, perform one **engangement** with one group of units, until all players have passed.
An engaging group of units can start the move in several different areas but they have to engage the same area that is either contested or controlled by other players.

To make an **engagement**, move a group of units from one area to another area that's not under your control. 

From here, there are 3 scenarios:

1. If the area is neutral, place one of your **Control Markers** on the engaged area. You now control the engaged area. 
If some of the engaging units have movement points left, they can immediately perform another engagement or move to adjacent areas under control.

2. If the area is under control of other players, place one of your **Control Marker** on the **Game Board** area to indicate the engagement. 
The player controlling the area has to say whether or not there are any units or buildings.

2.1. If there are no units/buildings in the engaged area, keep your **Control Marker** on the Game Baord area and remove any **Control Markers** of other players. 
You now control the engaged area.

2.2. If there are units/buildings, immediately move all units into the area onto the **Game Board** area so they become visible to anyone, including the engaging units.
Then, carry out a round of **Combat**, described in the next section.

3. If the area is contested and you have a **Control Marker** on the area, move the units directly to the new **Game Board** area and perform a round of combat.
